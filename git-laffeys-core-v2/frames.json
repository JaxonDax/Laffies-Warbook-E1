The colors were inspired by ancient myths of heroic defenders, drawing comparisons to knightly heraldry from Old Terra. However, the flashy design sparked controversy within the utilitarian GMS community. Critics claimed it was unnecessary for a mech designed for mass production and versatility. Originally developed under the codename Fortress Adaptive Deployment Frame (FADF), the Castle was part of a GMS initiative to appeal to security contractors, planetary defense forces, and humanitarian organizations requiring mobile, heavy-duty protection platforms. However, budget overruns, logistical delays, and skepticism about its specialized role and flashy design led to the project being quietly shelved for years. Despite this, several prototypes were distributed to field testers, and the results spoke for themselves—wherever the Castle stood, its allies did not fall.",

In combat, the Wayfarer does not advance so much as pass through, striking in straight, merciless lines before vanishing down another route. Enemies that attempt to pin it in place quickly discover the flaw in that strategy: the Wayfarer is already gone, leaving heat, fire, and shattered momentum behind.",
