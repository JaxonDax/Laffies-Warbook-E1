  "effect": "You may use your superheavy weapon when you overcharge as a quick action but you roll your overcharge die again adding the additional heat. This does not trigger the next level of overcharge just the current level again.",
  "description": "HA’s R&D department has found a way to stress a mech’s reactor enough to allow it to fire a super-heavy rated weapon while overcharging. However, tests have shown that the limit of such a modification is typically twice every 10 hours for standard mechs, with more opportunities available if the pilot is skilled in engineering and has additional HA core modifications."
