      "flavor": "The term ‘Chaingunner’ denotes a particular style of mech armament, with a bipod or tripod-stabilized superheavy weapon as the focal point.  These frames can often be found in forces with limited resources, where a single frame may need to fill many battlefield roles.",
      "tactics": "The chaingunner is very heavily armed but slow to get its weapons on target - move up aggressively to screen objectives or protect the flanks of teammates.  It is extremely vulnerable to flanking attacks, but punishes head-on attacks.  Its secondary weapons are not very dangerous but give it token self-defense while on the move."
