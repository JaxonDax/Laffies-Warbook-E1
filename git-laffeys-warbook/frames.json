    "description": "The Crusader, Steel Core's CQC Striker mech, wasn't born from Etsio’s hands but from his mind. Etsio directed its creation with a singular vision: a machine built for front-line domination, designed to survive the harshest of engagements and turn the tide in close-quarters combat. He was notorious for sitting down with STC’s top engineers, not to micromanage the technical details, but to lay down the essence of what the Crusader needed to be—a relentless, unstoppable force. “If it can’t take a hit, I don’t want it,” he famously declared. This led to the Crusader’s thick armor and the integration of the Shock Shield, ensuring it could shrug off the heaviest blows and explosive damage. Etsio envisioned the Crusader as a juggernaut in melee combat. He didn’t care for long-range artillery, so the engineers crafted the Pile Bunker, a tungsten spike launcher capable of punching through any armor and finishing foes with ruthless efficiency. The integration of the Blitz Core into the Crusader was Etsio’s crowning touch. He demanded a system that would let the Crusader charge across the battlefield, disregarding enemy reactions and tearing through defenses. The Blitz Core perfectly encapsulated his philosophy: never stop moving, never stop attacking. With the core active, the Crusader became a blur of destructive energy, knocking down enemies and delivering punishing hits with enhanced speed.",

Whether fighting in open space or in the depths of alien environments, the Mariana can handle it all. GMS saw the success of the Everest and decided to push the limits of what a standard frame could offer. The Mariana was designed to be the Everest MK II, incorporating years of field data, pilot feedback, and evolving battlefield needs. It's not just a frame for rookies learning the ropes—it’s built for seasoned veterans who need a platform that can be fine-tuned to their unique combat style. The inclusion of enhanced mod slots and more streamlined repair capabilities ensures that the Mariana can be refitted and rearmed with ease, making it ideal for extended campaigns where support might be limited.",

These systems were an innovation in field support: the IRDS drone could be deployed to handle repairs autonomously while the pilot attended to more urgent matters, while the RAAR enabled Thalia to shore up the defenses of critically damaged mechs and restore operational efficiency in seconds.",

However, the flashy design sparked controversy within the utilitarian GMS community. Critics claimed it was unnecessary for a mech designed for mass production and versatility. Originally developed under the codename Fortress Adaptive Deployment Frame (FADF), the Castle was part of a GMS initiative to appeal to security contractors, planetary defense forces, and humanitarian organizations requiring mobile, heavy-duty protection platforms. However, budget overruns, logistical delays, and skepticism about its specialized role and flashy design led to the project being quietly shelved for years. Despite this, several prototypes were distributed to field testers, and the results spoke for themselves—wherever the Castle stood, its allies did not fall.",
