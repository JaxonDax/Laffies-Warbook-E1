    "description": "ACRUX—colloquially known as ACR—is GMS's black-ops adjacent, ultra-resilient engineering division. Born from the need to deliver combat-ready, modular, and nigh-indestructible systems to GMS special operations, forward scouts, and long-haul campaigns, ACRUX embraces a simple design philosophy: survive first, adapt second, eliminate third. Where GMS is universal, reliable, and trusted, ACR is the high-end, battlefield-customizable evolution, maintaining GMS' rugged dependability but augmenting it with bleeding-edge materials and modular combat architecture."
